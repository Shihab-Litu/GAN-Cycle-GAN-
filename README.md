# GAN-Cycle-GAN-

A generative adversarial network is a class of machine learning frameworks invented by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set.


GAN is an unsupervised deep learning algorithm where we have a Generator pitted against an adversarial network called Discriminator.
Generator generates counterfeit currency. Discriminators are a team of cops trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Counterfeiters and cops both are trying to beat each other at their game.
Both Generator and Discriminator will be multi-layer perceptrons(MLP).

Generatorâ€™s objective will be to generate data that is very similar to the training data. Data generated from Generator should be indistinguishable from the real data.
Discriminator takes two sets of input, one input comes from the training dataset(real data) and the other input is the dataset generated by Generator.

Here I have Show one example of GAN using as input Horse an Zebra image.
